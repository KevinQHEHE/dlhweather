## 📖 **My Story** *(feel free to skip)* 

Setting up a Hadoop cluster manually can be frustrating, especially for beginners. My friends and I faced several challenges when deploying a multi-node Hadoop cluster on **VMware**, such as configuration issues, poor scalability, and inefficient resource usage. To solve these problems, I developed **HaMu**, a tool that simplifies Hadoop deployment using Docker containers.  

I first learned about Hadoop in the **Introduction to Big Data** course at my university. The subject itself was not difficult, but it became challenging when my friends and I had to deploy a multi-node Hadoop cluster on **VMware**. While Hadoop is powerful, using VMware introduced several inconveniences, such as:  

- Inability to scroll up to read errors in the terminal  
- Unfriendly communication with external systems  
- Weak performance due to virtualization overhead  
- Difficulty in scaling out  
- High storage usage for backups  
- Long rebuild times when making mistakes  

To address these issues, I decided to containerize the Hadoop system using **Docker**. This project serves as a final summary of my knowledge in both Hadoop and Docker.  

💡 I hope **HaMu** helps you quickly set up a Hadoop multi-node cluster, making it easier and more efficient to practice Hadoop. 🚀

### Modify the Owner Name  
If you need to change the owner name, run the `rename-owner.py` script and enter your new owner name when prompted.  

> **⏳ Note:** If you want to check the current owner name, it is stored in `OwnerName.txt`.
>
> 📌 There are some limitations; you should use a name that is different from words related to the 'Hadoop' or 'Docker' syntax. For example, avoid names like 'hdfs', 'yarn', 'container', or 'docker-compose'.

```sh
python rename-owner.py
```

### 🌐 Interact with the Web UI  

You can access the following web interfaces to monitor and manage your Hadoop cluster:  

- **YARN Resource Manager UI** → [http://localhost:9004](http://localhost:9004)  
  Provides an overview of cluster resource usage, running applications, and job details.  

- **NameNode UI** → [http://localhost:9870](http://localhost:9870)  
  Displays HDFS file system details, block distribution, and overall health status.
